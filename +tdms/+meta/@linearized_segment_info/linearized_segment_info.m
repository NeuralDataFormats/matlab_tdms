    %   TODO: Move elements of "fixed" into here
    %
    %   I think I wanted stuff like the old raw in here
    
    
    %??? How to proceed
    %For each final object
    %
    %
    %   Perhaps I want to create a final_segment_info
    %
    %   id
    %   final_id
    %   data_type
    %   # of values to read per chunk
    %   total size in bytes
    %
    %   Add on interleaved and big endian
    %
    %   Verify:
    %   things don't change
    %
    %   propogate read order into these objects
    %
    %   Start off by making this nice and slow
    %
    %   Start creating a final object - maybe some of this is linearized
    %   - name
    %   - data type
    %   - properties
    %   - n_segs ?????
    %   - n_reads ????
